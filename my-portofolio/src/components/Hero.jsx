            My name is Georgos Zacharopoulos, and I am a Greek student currently
            enrolled at the University of Thessaly in the Department of
            Information Technology and Telecommunications. I have been
            passionate about programming for the past two years, during which
            time I have completed several projects, both independently and in
            collaboration with other developers. Additionally, I have acquired
            skills in creating static websites for businesses. I am highly
            motivated to learn new technologies and methodologies to tackle
            diverse projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, going to
            the gym, and cooking.
